  <description>Exploring mechanites beyond just Luciferum.
Use the Mechanite Forge and start crafting your own! Even let your colonists ascend to greater heights with Seraphium like the angels.

*Bastion is a drug which let your colonists stand their ground better by repelling any incoming damage much like a personal shield. Also the flankers best friend in their arsenal. Be sure to take cover when it breaks!

*Seraphium is a wonder drug that greatly increase the fortitude of your colonists by allowing them to take on disease like a champ, clot their wounds during battle and over a quadrum regrow lost limbs and organs. There is a catch though when regrowing lost bits; It hurts. A LOT!

*Trollbood which let you regenerate wounds on the fly, even old scars! Perfect companion drug to Seraphium.

*Addiction purifier will make even the most immersed junkie drug free at first use. Also helps your colonists stop dealing with the devil.

*Herculium and Peithium are benign mechanites of the fibrous and sensory mechanite diseases. They also act as a cure if they are taken after being infected with fibrous or sensory mechanites.

Secondary usage of the Mechanite Forge let you manufacture neutroamine and plasteel with appropiate research.
